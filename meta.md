# Class information for teachers

This material under this GitHub organization is for a 15-session Creative Coding course at Parsons The New School for Design. It consists of:

* [A repository for the syllabus](README.md)
* [A repository for the slides](https://github.com/parsons-cc/slides)
* One repository per assignment (everything else listed under https://github.com/parsons-cc)

## Materials

All class materials and assignments are in public repositories under a single organization, which has the added benefits of:

* Keeps everything easy to find
* Giving students experience with:
    * Interacting and contributing to open source
    * Getting comfortable with Git & GitHub
* Making it easy for others to watch changes, fork, create issues and pull requests against the class materials
* Setting up an expectation of trust with the students

## Structure

The structure of the class relies heavily on GitHub features, so as a bonus it acts as a testbed for recommendations made as part of the [GitHub Education program](https://education.github.com).  For example:

* The [**syllabus is posted publicly**](https://education.github.com/guide#3-post-your-syllabus), where students can "watch" to be notified of changes, give feedback on class structure, or even propose additional resources.
* Assignments are **structured using the [Forks](https://education.github.com/guide/forks) strategy**.
    * **Pull requests are used to turn in assignments** and give feedback – see [the workflow](README.md#workflow) and [the guide](https://education.github.com/guide/forks#3-completing-assignments).
* **[The slides](http://parsons-cc.github.io/slides.html) are public webpages**, hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
* By [setting the default branch](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-the-default-branch) in each assignment repository to be `gh-pages`, **every student's fork/submission is then a live Pages site** that can be used for grading, so the files never need to be downloaded for grading.
* Students are added to teams by term (e.g. `summer-2014`), so that **[team mentions](https://github.com/blog/1121-introducing-team-mentions)** can be used to direct everyone's attention to important syllabus changes or important pieces of feedback.
    * As part of the first class, students submit pull requests to add themselves to the [students](https://github.com/advanced-js/students) repository.  This is partially to collect their usernames, and partially to tie their usernames to their real names.  [A script](https://github.com/advanced-js/students/blob/master/add_students.rb) is then run to automatically add them to the team for that term.

## Sharing

The material is free to modify and distribute – if you end up using some of all of the material for your own class, training materials, etc., I would love to [hear from you](https://github.com/parsons-cc/syllabus/issues/new)!
